            <p>Harry Potter is a series of seven fantasy novels written by British author J. K. Rowling.
                The novels chronicle the lives of a young wizard, Harry Potter, and his friends Hermione Granger and Ron
                Weasley, all of whom are students at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. The main story arc
                concerns Harry's conflict with Lord Voldemort, a dark wizard who intends to become immortal, overthrow

            <p>War and Peace is a literary work by Russian author Leo Tolstoy. Set during the Napoleonic
                Wars, the work mixes fictional narrative with chapters discussing history and philosophy. An early
                version was published serially beginning in 1865, after which the entire book was rewritten and
                published in 1869. It is regarded, with Anna Karenina, as Tolstoy's finest literary achievement and
                remains an internationally praised classic of world literature.</p>

                Jazz Age on Long Island, near New York City, the novel depicts first-person narrator Nick Carraway's
                interactions with mysterious millionaire Jay Gatsby and Gatsby's obsession to reunite with his former
                lover, Daisy Buchanan.The novel was inspired by a youthful romance Fitzgerald had with socialite Ginevra
                King, and the riotous parties he attended on Long Island's North Shore in 1922. Following a move to the
                French Riviera, Fitzgerald completed a rough draft of the novel in 1924.</p>

                following his return from ten years of exile in Siberia. Crime and Punishment is considered the first

            <p><img src="images/ws.jpg" alt=""><span style="font-weight: bold;">William Shakespeare </span>(c. 23[a]
                April 1564 - 23 April
                1616)[b] was an English playwright, poet, and actor.
                He
                is widely regarded as the greatest writer in the English language and the world's pre-eminent
                dramatist.[4][5][6] He is often called England's national poet and the "Bard of Avon" (or simply "the
                Bard"). His extant works, including collaborations, consist of some 39 plays, 154 sonnets, three long
                narrative poems, and a few other verses, some of uncertain authorship. His plays have been translated
                into
                every major living language and are performed more often than those of any other playwright.[7]
                Shakespeare
                remains arguably the most influential writer in the English language, and his works continue to be
                studied
                and reinterpreted.</p>

                February 1812 9 June 1870
                was an English novelist and social critic who
                created
                some of the world's best-known fictional characters, and is regarded by many as the greatest novelist of
                the
                Victorian era.[1] His works enjoyed unprecedented popularity during his lifetime and, by the 20th
                century,
                critics and scholars had recognised him as a literary genius. His novels and short stories are widely
                read
                today Born in Portsmouth, Dickens left school at age 12 to work in a boot-blacking factory when his
                father
                John was incarcerated in a debtors' prison. After three years, he returned to school before beginning
                his
                literary career as a journalist. Dickens edited a weekly journal for 20 years; wrote 15 novels, five
                novellas, hundreds of short stories and nonfiction articles; lectured and performed readings
                extensively;
                was an indefatigable letter writer; and campaigned vigorously for children's rights, education, and
                other
                social reforms.</p>

                9 September [O.S. 28
                August] 1828 - 20 November [O.S. 7 November] 1910,
                usually referred to in English as Leo Tolstoy, was a Russian writer. He is regarded as one of the
                greatest
                and most influential authors of all time.[3][4] He received nominations for the Nobel Prize in
                Literature
                every year from 1902 to 1906 and for the Nobel Peace Prize in 1901, 1902, and 1909.Born into an
                aristocratic
                family, Tolstoy's notable works include the novels War and Peace (1869) and Anna Karenina (1878),[5]
                often
                cited as pinnacles of realist fiction,[2] and two of the greatest books of all time.[3][4] He first
                achieved
                literary acclaim in his twenties with his semi-autobiographical trilogy, Childhood, Boyhood, and Youth
                (1852-1856), and Sevastopol Sketches (1855), based upon his experiences in the Crimean War.</p>
